# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository documents the Requirement Analysis phase for a booking management system. It provides a comprehensive guide on identifying, structuring, and documenting requirements to ensure successful project execution.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders in software development. It ensures the final product aligns with business goals, user needs, and technical constraints. This phase is critical in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) as it lays the foundation for the entire project.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. **Clarity and Precision:** Ensures all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the project scope.
2. **Risk Reduction:** Identifies potential challenges early in the project.
3. **Improved Communication:** Bridges the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting inputs from stakeholders.
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Refining and clarifying requirements using techniques like interviews and brainstorming.
- **Requirement Documentation:** Structuring requirements in a clear format.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Visualizing requirements using diagrams and models.
- **Requirement Validation:** Confirming that requirements are accurate, complete, and achievable.

## Types of Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Define system actions.
- Examples for the booking system:
  - User can register and log in.
  - User can book, cancel, or modify reservations.

### Non-functional Requirements
- Define system qualities.
- Examples for the booking system:
  - System should handle 1000 concurrent users.
  - Response time should not exceed 2 seconds.

## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams visually depict system actors and their interactions with the system. They help stakeholders understand the system's functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria are specific conditions that must be met for a feature to be considered complete. They ensure alignment with user needs and business goals.

**Example:**  
- **Feature:** Checkout.  
- **Criteria:**
  - Users can securely pay using credit card or PayPal.
  - Users receive a confirmation email after payment.
